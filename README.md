Project-1 : Implementing a Driver Fatigue Detection System 

Driver Fatigue or Drowsiness is one of the key contributions to road accidents. 
As per the IEEE Survey, more than 30 percent of the accidents occurring day/ night are due to the frequent sleepiness drivers commit while traversing to longer or shorter routes. What if we find such a system that detects such fatigue anytime? This is possible with the real-time implementation of a driver drowsiness project which requires a webcam and some libraries of Python programming language (those libraries would be Keras, Open CV). 
The webcam will be doing face recognition while on the other hand Keras and Open CV will also be offering valuable contributions. 
They would be like Keras will examine whether the driverâ€™s eye is closed or open (you will find the contrivance of Deep Neural Network techniques while using Keras); Open CV will scan the eye and face of the driver.
As the driver falls asleep, these libraries and webcam come into action and force the triggering of the alarm for the sake of alerting the driver. 
Such a project can reduce the increase in the number of road accidents and also ensures public safety round-the-clock.
